uncommon in children compared to adults The prevalence  of  palpable  thyroid  nodules  in  children  ranges  from    to    Sporadic  welldifferentiated thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy in children accounting for  of pediatric cancers  in  the  prepubertal  age  group  and  up  to   of cancers in adolescents aged ?year2 The most common indication for thyroid surgery in children varies among published studies but thyroidectomy for malignant conditions is rising38 Data in children throughout the  world  are  relatively  scarce  The  objective  of  this study was to analyze the clinical data and outcome of thyroid  surgery  in  a  large  series  of  children  treated  at a  single  center  at  King  Faisal  Specialist  Hospital  and Research Center KFSHRC in RiyadhPATIENT AND METHODS With the approval of the Institutional Review Board IRB at KFSHRC the medical records of all patients  years old and younger who underwent a thyroid surgery between    and    were  retrospectively  reviewed We elected to include patients up to the year  to ensure a reasonable followup period Patients for the study were identified by a search of the operating room log for all procedures involving the thyroid gland for the specified age groupDemographic  data  clinical  features  and  surgical outcomes  were  collected  Specific  data  that  were  obtained included age at operation gender family history presenting  symptoms  history  of  radiation  exposure presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type  MEN   thyroid  function  test  presence  and  size  of  thyroid nodules by ultrasound presence of lymph nodes metastasis or distant metastasis fine needle aspiration FNA cytology  surgical  procedure  final  histopathology  and length of followup Outcomes analyzed were postoperative complications including transient or permanent hypocalcemia  transient  or  permanent  recurrent  laryngeal nerve paralysis wound infection and hematoma length of stay and radioactive iodine treatment and recurrences Thyroid procedures in this series included hemithyroidectomy  subtotal  total  and  completion  thyroidectomy Surgeries were performed by either an endocrine adult surgeon or a pediatric surgeon No intraoperative nerve monitoring was used Early in the series procedures were performed by adult endocrine surgeons but lately a combined approach was adopted where pediatric surgeons and adult endocrine surgeons collaborated in such cases  proceduresthe normal range in our laboratory regardless of symptoms Transient hypocalcemia was identified if it lasted for less than  months while permanent hypocalcemia was  considered  if  the  serum  calcium  level  remained below normal range and the patient continued on calcium  supplementation  after    months  of  the  surgery All patients with a family history of MEN  underwent genetic testing of the RET protooncogene to confirm the diagnosis All patients who underwent completion thyroidectomy  had  a  preoperative  and  postoperative vocal  cords  assessment  at  the  Otolaryngology  clinic Descriptive data were generated and comparisons were conducted using the t test for continuous data

final  histopathology  in  of cases There were three cases of toxic adenoma and one case of Graves?disease which did not require FNA  The  remaining  cases  underwent  FNA  at  another institution and FNA was not repeated at our institution or they came for completion thyroidectomy with documented  pathology  for  malignancy  after  they  had  their first surgery in another hospitalThe  most

medullary thyroid cancer  so  did  not  receive  RAI  In  the  remaining  five cases  there was no clear data whether those patients received RAI before or only after a recurrence All local recurrences  underwent  resection  except  for  one  patient who was lost follow up There was no mortality in this study DISCUSSIONThe most common indication for thyroidectomy in this series was thyroid nodule which correlates with previously published reports in the pediatric population35 Children with thyroid nodules have an estimated fourfold  higher  risk  of  developing  thyroid  cancer  compared to adults910 The high incidence of malignancy in this series suggests children with a thyroid nodule should be carefully evaluatedFNA is a valuablemethod for preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules However there are limitations on  the  routine  use  of  FNA  in  children  including  the need  for  sedation  sampling  errors  and  the  limited availability  of  experienced  cytopathologists11  Many previous studies reported high sensitivity and specificity of FNA in evaluating thyroid nodule in children1114 which correlate with our findingsOur data showed lymph node metastasis in  of  thyroid  cancer  cases  which  supports  the  notion that  children  with  thyroid  cancer  frequently  present with more extensive disease than adults Lymphnode involvement  at  diagnosis  is  seen  in    to    of children  compared  with    to    of  adults  with differentiated thyroid cancer1523 Because our hospital is the largest referral center in Saudi Arabia especially for oncology cases this may explain the large number of lymph node and distant metastasis In this cohortThe  most  common  complication  reported  after thyroidectomy in children is hypoparathyroidism with an incidence ranging between  to  which original PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0ccorresponds with our results of  which are reported as hypocalcemia in Table    One study found that total thyroidectomy central and bilateral neck dissection Graves?disease and malignancy were  risk  factors  for  hypocalcemia  after  thyroid  surgery3 In this cohort postoperative hypocalcemia was noted more in malignant cases but it failed to reach statistical significance Moreover there was no significant difference between benign and malignant cases in  terms  of  mean  age  gender  distribution  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or overall complications a finding that was reported previously26 Multiple studies in recent years have found an inverse relationship between surgeon volume and complication  rates2728  but  similar  data  in  the  pediatric population is lacking One study found that highvolume  endocrine  surgeons  have  better  outcomes  and shorter lengths of stay and lower costs after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy in children compared to pediatric surgeons general surgeons or otolaryngologists29  Scheumann  and  colleagues  also  concluded that a collaborative approach between pediatric and endocrine surgeons would have better outcomes This has led other authors to suggest that a combined approach with endocrine and pediatric surgeons in addition to pediatric endocrinologists may optimize the care of children with surgical thyroid disease given the low number of pediatric patients4 Our data do not allow for comparisons of different approaches given the late adoption of the combined approach The  recurrence  rate  for  thyroid  cancer  in  children after  thyroidectomy  has  varied  widely  in  reported studies  ranging  from    to    while  it  was   in  this  cohort  Only  a  few  studies  explored  the predictors  of  recurrence  Lymph  node  involvement multiple nodules male gender younger age histologic subtype and advanced tumor stage were risk factors associated with recurrence17233033 In  this  study    of  patients  with  malignant  lesions received RAI Although there are conflicting data regarding  the  indications  of  postoperative  RAI  treatment in lowrisk patients the current recommendation is that lowrisk patients can be treated without RAI3436There are some limitations to this study The retrospective nature may affect the validity and quality of the data The small number of cases in some categories did not enable us to compare groups and explore predictors relative to these factors On the other hand this study adds to the scarce data on thyroid surgery in pediatric age group Malignancy is the commonest indication  for  thyroid  surgery  in  children  and  FNA  is highly  diagnostic  Hypocalcemia  and  recurrent  laryngeal nerve injury are significant complications Cancerrelated  death  is  extremely  rare  but  recurrence  is  not uncommon and a significant number of patients with malignant cases received RAI treatmentoriginal PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0cREFERENCES  Trowbridge  FL

1,Thyroid_Cancer,""" The adopted strategy was the same as that used in prior years [] and is based on four exclusive queries that return  four  disjoint  citation  subsets The first query QPub_plain is based on a plaintext search in PubMed titles and s using keywords The  second  query  QPub_indexed relies on the PubMed indexing scheme using MeSH terms and results are made exclusive of the previous set The third one QWoS_restricted is based on a plaintext search in WoS restricted to the two research areas Medical Informatics?and Health Care Sciences  Services?The fourth query QWoS_filtered is based on the same plaintext search used in WoS but filtered by nonrelevant research areas eg Archeology Dance Zoology etc and the two research areas of the previous query It is of note that the two WoS queries select  only  nonPubMedindexed  papers that are supposed to be caught by the two PubMed queriesA  first  review  of  the  four  subsets  of retrieved  citations  was  performed  by  the two section editors to select  candidate best papers Following the IMIA Yearbook protocol these candidate best papers were then individually reviewed and rated by both section editors the chief editor of the Decision Support section and external reviewers from the international Medical Informatics community Based on the reviewers?ratings and comments the Yearbook editorial committee then selected the best papers of the year in the decision support domainIMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics                                    IMIA and Ge Thieme Verlag KG 0cReview Results The    literature  search  has  been  performed on January   A total of  unique references were obtained distributed as follows  for QPub_plain  for QPub_indexed  for QWoS_restricted and  for QWoS_filtered yielding subtotals of  references from PubMed and  from WoS Compared to the previous year the global query retrieved   more  papers After  a  first  individual screening independently performed by both section editors based on the title and  of papers  not rejected by both section editors were discussed by the two editors to achieve a final selection of  candidate best  papers After  the  external  review  of these    s  the  editorial  committee finally selected three of them as best papers for  [? Table  They are discussed in the next section and summaries of their contents are available in the AppendixDiscussion and OutlookIn the first paper Hendriks  [] propose an approach to the modeling of clinical practice guidelines which certainly builds on already existing approaches but which is systematically conducted in order to be scalable and used to represent complex guidelines They promote the formalism of clinical decision trees CDTs as they are both clinically interpretable  by  healthcare  professionals and  computerinterpretable  thus  suitable for implementation in datadriven CDSSs The disambiguation of textual guidelines is supported first by the formal unequivocal specification of data items used as decision criteria using international coding systems to enforce interoperability and second by the representation of guideline knowledge as CDTs The method is applied to the Dutch breast cancer guidelines Sixty CDTs were built  involving  a  total  of    data  items among  which    could  not  be  linked  to standard terminologies The authors report the ambiguity of certain criteria which could be subjective or had multiple definitions The resulting knowledge base was implemented in a decision support application where it can be interactively browsed or automatically executed By modeling guidelines in such a way this work is a step forward in the sharing of encoded knowledgeIn the second paper KamiÅ¡aliÄ  [] tackled the issues linked to the formalization of the medical processes used for managing chronic diseases and their execution in CDSSs They analyzed the decisionmaking dimensions of the therapeutic management of chronic diseases like those known to increase the cardiovascular risk and identified three basic levels therapy strategy dosage adaptation and intolerance management To handle these  different  aspects  consistently  they propose a formalism called extended Timed Transition Diagram eTTD With eTTDs they illustrate the multilevel and finegrained modeling required to capture the contents of arterial hypertension management guidelines This detailed demonstration on how procedural knowledge for hypertension management can be formalized to develop a CDSS could certainly be used in other medical domainsThe third paper by Khalifa  [] presents a conceptual and practical framework to help assess confidence in predictive tools GRASP  for  Grade  and Assess  Predictive Tools is both a method to look for evidence from the published literature and an analysis grid It standardizes the assessment of the available literature associated to a predictive tool and the grading of its level of proof Three phases of evaluation are considered i before the implementation of the tool to assess both its internal and external validity ii during the implementation to assess its potential effect and usability and iii after the implementation to assess its effectiveness and safety In each phase the level of evidence  can  be  assessed  from  the  study design A qualitative  summarizes the direction of evidence positive negative mixed This grid can be considered as similar to existing grids for instance the CONSORT statement for clinical trials However it gives a rigorous methodology for a critical appraisal of predictive tools and could be extended to all kind of CDSSs It might be a useful tool to extend the evidencebased culture in the field of medical informaticsBesides the three best papers selected for the  Decision  Support section  of  the   edition of the IMIA Yearbook several other works retrieved from the literature review deserve to be cited Some of them deal with the personalization of decisions Laleci   []  propose  a  scientific  and  technical approach to develop personalized care plans that comply with clinical practice guidelines for the management of complex polypathology situations Jafarpour  [] propose a solution to dynamically manage the conflicts that can rise in this type of complex contexts Ben Souissi  [] introduce the use of health  information  technology  involving multiple criteria decision to support the choice between antibiotics alternatives Interestingly other works promote the creation and sharing of operational knowledge bases as exemplified by Hendriks  [] Thus Huibers  [] transform the textual STOPPSTART criteria into unambiguous definitions mapped to  medical  terminologies  Canovas et  al [] formalize EUCAST expert rules as an ontology and production rules to detect antimicrobial therapies at risk of failure M¼ller  [] propose an   diagnostic knowledge base that can compete with commercial ones Replacing humans is another topic of research and Spnig  [] work on two aspects to virtualize a doctor the automatic acquisition of data through sensors and speech recognition and the automation of diagnostic reasoning Rozenblum et al[] propose a machine learning method to generate clinically valid alerts to detect errors in prescriptions Acceptability  of  CDSS  is  another  key point Kannan  [] propose a method for a CDSS design to best meet a precisely specified and assessable user purpose Design alerts  may  also  avoid  rejection  of  CDSSs by caregivers Fernandes  [] created algorithms able to aggregate filter and reduce the notifications delivered to healthcare professionals Amrose et  al [] tried to understand in real life the impact of alerts on users and to find the actions they triggered Finally it is always interesting to obtain varied evaluation results of controversial CDSSs In this respect Kim  [] evaluated Watson for Oncology in thyroid carcinoma and reported a concordance rate with local practices considered as too low to adopt the tool As  evidenced  by  the  number  and  the variety of works around decision support research in the field is very active This years selection highlighted pragmatic works that promote the transparency and sharing of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2020Duclos

May3114Since  clinical  practice  guidelines  are  still narrative and described in large textual documents the aim of this work was to model complex guidelines as datadriven clinical decision trees CDTs that could be still humaninterpretable while computerinterpretable for implementation in decision support systems The Dutch national breast cancer guidelines were translated into CDTs Data items  which  characterize  the  patient  and the tumor and represent decisional criteria were encoded unambiguously using existing classifications and coding systems related to breast cancer when feasible

bypass proceduresIntroductionCoronary artery bypass grafting CABG is a method of choicefor revascularization in patients with multivessel disease anddiabetes mellitus DM Although arterial grafts are preferredin selected scenarios the common practice is to use leftinternal thoracic artery LITA to bypass the left anteriordescending artery LAD and to place venous conduits toother target vessels An

built of the layer of endothelial cellson the luminal side the media consists of smooth musclecells and the adventitia forms the outer part8 In a normalsetting the endothelium is crucial for vein integrity andprevention of thrombosis9 and its focal disruption maypredispose to vessel thrombosis2 SV manipulation andimplantation leads to loss of endothelial integrity and elicitsan inï¬ammatory response with platelet adhesion and leukocyte recruitment Notwithstanding an overt thrombosis isextremely rare in the operating room SV dissection results inblood ï¬ow disruption in vasa vasorum and causes adventitial damage hypoxia and vessel wall hyponutrition10 Acuteperioperative saphenous vein graft failure is almost always aresult of graft thrombosis but this very uncommonly occursprior to graft placement Surgical factorslike technicalanastomotic failure or severe disproportion between thetarget vessel and the graft may lead to thrombosis butvessel injury and hypercoagulability are among potentialcauses as well11There was no evident inï¬ammatory process in microscopy inour patient but even if an inï¬ammatory process was presentTH  Vol  No 0cBilateral Saphenous Vein Thrombosis during CABG Mazur et ale201preoperatively in our patients SVs the inï¬ammatory background alone could not explain the dramatic intraoperativethrombosis We hypothesized that increased thrombin generation and prothrombotic ï¬brin clot phenotype were responsiblefor the clinical presentation Conversion of ï¬brinogen to ï¬brinfacilitated by thrombin is a concluding step of coagulation Ithas been shown that ï¬brin clots with small pores betweentightly packed thin ï¬brin ï¬bers are relatively lysis resistant12Such clot phenotype has been evidenced in multiple thromboticpathologies such as myocardial infarction6 ischemic stroke13and venous thromboembolism4 The prothrombotic clotphenotype reï¬ected by a tendency to form dense ï¬brin clotsresistant to lysis has been previously reported in patients withinstent thrombosis14 While routine thrombophilia screeningresults in a high almost  detection rate of commonhypercoagulable states15 there are prothrombotic conditionsthat escape routine diagnostic approach The overall microscopic clot appearance and prothrombotic ï¬brin properties lead tothe discovery of two mutations in our patient that are notroutinely tested during thrombophilia screening namely ï¬brinogen 455G  A and FXIII100G  TElevated ï¬brinogen was postulated as one of the riskfactors for early graft failure after CABG1116 Epidemiologicalstudies have

[ CI ?for AA Ã¾ GA vs GG19 In a recent study of patients with atrialï¬brillation Hu and colleagues found that the A allele of ï¬brinogen 455G  A was a risk factor for cardioembolicstroke probably by elevating the level of plasma ï¬brinogen20 On the other hand in a  metaanalysis of studies involving  cases and  controls FXIIIVal34Leu polymorphism was shown to be associated withrisk myocardial infarction21 FXIII is crucial to thrombusstabilization and changes of its plasma concentration reï¬ectnonspeciï¬cally the extent of thrombosis as shown by Li et alin a study on patients with cerebral venous thrombosis22Interesting associations of FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism andthrombotic disorders have been reported Jung et al reportedin a metaanalysis of  studies that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss23Although no association with the incidence of ischemicstroke was found for this polymorphism24 apparentlywhen the stroke occurs Val34Leu polymorphism of FXIIIaffects the severity of its outcome25 Furthermore Kreutzand colleagues suggested in  that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism may increase risk of recurrent MI and death inpatients with angiographically established coronary arterydisease26 In  our group has shown in a study of patients that in patients undergoing CABG FXIII Leu34 alleleis associated with decreased ï¬brin clot

IntroductionPapillary thyroid carcinoma PTCis acommon thyroid malignancy accountingfor about  of systemic malignancies1PTC is currently characterized by a highincidence and low mortality2clinicalRecentimprovementsin highfrequencyultrasonic diagnostic technologies and theapplication of ultrasoundguided puncturetechniques have led to an apparent increasein the incidence of PTC year by year3Regardingthyroidtumors the palpation detection rate forthyroid microtumors in the general population is about  compared with as highas  to  for highfrequency ultrasound6 which has thus greatly improveddisease diagnosisdiagnosistheofSurgical resection is a routine treatmentfor thyroid tumors but the recurrence rateis usually high and the consequent reduction in thyroid function can seriously affectthe patients quality of life7 Associatedwith the increasing detection rate of thyroidtumors and the pursuit of minimally invasive treatments radiofrequency ablationRFA has been gradually applied in theclinic RFA uses local hyperthermia tocause tissue necrosis The thermal effectsdo not depend on the tissue type andmost lesions can be completely eliminatedby RFA89 RFA has thus become a novellocal treatment for tumorsThe clinical diagnosis of benign andmalignant thyroid tumors currently dependson the clinical manifestations and pathological examinations Howeverthe

serum levels MMP2and MMP9 were lower in the ï¬rst monthafter surgery compared with before surgerybut the difference was not signiï¬cant Thismight be because before ablationthetumor parenchyma induced the tumorstroma to produce larger amounts ofMMP2 and MMP9 which were releasedinto the blood These results suggest thatfailure to completely ablate the tumor ortumor recurrence may result in the secretionof high levels of MMP2 and MMP9 intothe blood However serum levels of MMP and MMP9 were signiï¬cantly decreasedat   and  months after surgery compared with before surgery suggesting thatserum MMP2 and MMP9 were secretedby the tumor The lesions disappearedafter PTC ablation thus reducing the secretion of MMP2 and MMP9 and therebyreducing the degradation and destructionof type IV

caused by the deposition of calcium salts at the tip of the nippleor the secretion of calcium salts by thetumor itself and has been considered tobe the most speciï¬c sign of PTC In thisstudy the

ablation highintensity focusedUS and particularly RFA have recentlybecome more widely used to treat thyroidthe creation ofnodules Brieï¬y the basic mechanism ofRFA involvesthermaldamage by friction and heat conductionwhich is generated from an oscillatinghighfrequency alternating electric currentproduced by the RFA generator and thentransferred through the electrode tip Theenergy of RFA is powerful and accurate2526 RFA is considered an effectiveand safe treatment for control of BTNsIn most cases the incidence of haemorrhage and other complications is low20However haemorrhage is sometimes lifethreatening because serious haematomasmay compress the upper airways Manyreports have described active bleedingduring FNA of thyroid nodules and RFAof hepatocellular carcinomas14 andsome reports have described fatalities14ThusimportantcomplicationhaemorrhageanisThree types of haemorrhage may occurperithyroidal subcapsular and intranodular121427?The mechanism of haemorrhage is thoughtto be related to themechanical or thermal injuries induced bythe RFA electrode tip3031 Thyroid nodulesreportedly have abundant capsular vesselsthat are usually anastomosed with vesselspenetrating into the core32 These numerousvessels are abnormal thinwalled and susceptible to rupture Large thyroid nodulesare another cause of haemorrhage becausemultiple insertions are often required totreat such nodules In additionthepatient cannot coordinate with the physician during the RFA procedure the perithyroidal orintrathyroidal vessels mayeasily be damaged by movement of theneedle tip or production of heat energyifIt is important to manage bleeding associated with RFA of BTNs Based on ourexperience we suggest several steps to preventshouldobtain a thorough medical

extravasation was observedskills are both essential Patient cooperationis the ï¬rst requirement When the needle tipis in the patients body any uncooperativemotion of the patient may lead to injury ofvessels or other structures Most patientscan endure the procedure under local anaesthesia however anxious patients mayrequire general anaesthesia to achieve cooperation If possible smallbore electrodesshould be chosen to decrease the risk ofbleeding35 It is necessary to cauterise thesupplying vasculature of nodules to avoidrecurrence and residue Howeverthepuncture route should be carefully designedto avoid pericapsular vessels and the electrode tip should be closely monitoredActive bleeding during needle puncture isvisible as a rapidly expanding hypoechoicor anechoic signal Locating the haemorrhagic focus is not difï¬cult with CEUSguidance The bleeding pointcan beblocked by RF electrode tip insertion anddirect ablation When the bleeding is toorapid to control with the RF electrode tipby increasing the power drug injection is asuitable alternative Lyophilised thrombin 0cHu et alpowder can be dissolved in normal salineand then injected at the bleeding pointthrough a syringe with US guidance Onereport also described haemorrhage treatedby local injection of hypertonic saline andepinephrine solution in a patient with hepatocarcinoma36 Mildbleeding whichappears as a hypoechoic layer can mostlybe controlled using ice and compression ofthe neck for several minutes after the procedure30 All bleeding can be controlled byconservative methodsthus no surgicalintervention is needed Ecchymosis can befound after the procedure and usually disappears in approximately  to  weeksPostprocedure CEUS is indispensablefor all patients regardless of whether bleeding occurs CEUS is an objective evaluationtool for active bleeding37 Close clinicalobservation for  hours postoperatively isrecommended in our department becausemost bleeding occurs during the ï¬rstlobectomy38Observation of the neck can help to detecta haematoma early and may aid in preventing serious adverse effectsthyroidhoursafterConclusionAcute thyroid bleeding is one possible complication of RFA although rare it is potentially lifethreatening Proper selection ofpatients and sufï¬cient preparation areessential During the RFA procedureboth an effective clinical strategy and adequate technical skills are indispensable Thephysician should trace the electrode tipusing realtime US and sufï¬ciently managebleeding Mild bleeding has limited morbidity and can be easily controlled by compression Active bleeding tends to be rarehowever it may be disastrous if the operator is unaware or careless Direct ablationwith the RF electrode tip and drug injectioninto the bleeding focus are effective modalities for active bleeding CEUS and closeobservation are also recommended afterthe procedureto detect abnormalitiesearly RFA is an effective and relativelysafe
